## Implementation Plan

**Objective:** Implement the rules and guidelines outlined in `global-rules.md` for the `next-nebula-saas` project.

**1. Analyze the `global-rules.md` file:**
   - Read the file content to understand the rules and guidelines.
   - Identify the key areas covered by the rules and the specific recommendations for each area.

**2. Identify the target audience:**
   - Determine who these rules are intended for (e.g., developers, project managers, designers).

**3. Define the scope of implementation:**
   - Determine which parts of the rules are applicable to the current project (`next-nebula-saas`).

**4. Prioritize the rules:**
   - Based on the project's needs and the priority levels specified in the rules (e.g., "Priority: Critical"), prioritize the implementation of the rules.

**5. Create a checklist for each rule:**
   - For each rule, create a checklist of specific actions that need to be taken to implement the rule.

**6. Assign responsibilities:**
   - Determine who is responsible for implementing each rule (e.g., developers, project managers, designers).

**7. Set deadlines:**
   - Set deadlines for implementing each rule.

**8. Create a communication plan:**
   - Determine how the rules will be communicated to the target audience and how feedback will be collected.

**9. Create a monitoring plan:**
   - Determine how the implementation of the rules will be monitored and how progress will be tracked.

**10. Document the plan:**
    - Document the plan in a clear and concise manner, including the rules, checklists, responsibilities, deadlines, communication plan, and monitoring plan.

**11. Present the plan to the user:**
    - Present the plan to the user for review and approval.

**12. Implement the plan:**
    - Once the plan is approved, switch to another mode to implement the solution.
