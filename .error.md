# Debug Error Report
******
**Severity Level**: Critical

**Status**: Open

**Description**: During the Vercel deployment process, the build failed due to a mismatch between the current "overrides" configuration in package.json and the values stored in the pnpm-lock.yaml file. This prevents the frozen installation process from proceeding.

**Environment**:
- Node.js Version: Not specified (Vercel environment)
- Package Manager: pnpm 10.x
- OS: Linux (Vercel build environment)
- Vercel CLI: 41.4.1

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Push code to the repository
2. Vercel attempts to build the project
3. PNPM dependency installation fails during build process

**Expected Behavior**:
The build process should successfully install dependencies using the pnpm-lock.yaml file and proceed with the deployment.

**Actual Behavior**:
The build fails with ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH error, indicating that the current "overrides" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile.

**Debug Information**:
- Stack Trace: Not available

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. The error message suggests running `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` to update the lockfile

**Resolution Steps**:
1. **Identify Root Cause**: The package.json file contains overrides that don't match the lockfile configuration
2. **Implement Fix**: Run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` locally to update the lockfile
3. **Test Solution**: Commit the updated lockfile and attempt deployment
4. **Regression Testing**: Verify that all dependencies are correctly resolved
5. **Documentation**: Update deployment documentation if needed

**Additional Notes**:
- Related Issues/PRs: N/A
- Impact Assessment: Blocking deployment of all new changes
- Dependencies Involved: All project dependencies managed by pnpm
