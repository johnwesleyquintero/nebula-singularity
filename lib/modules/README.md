# Modules Directory Structure

This directory contains the core modules of the application, organized by domain and functionality.

## Directory Structure

```
modules/
├── auth/           # Authentication related functionality
├── database/       # Database connections and configurations
├── organizations/  # Organization management
├── projects/       # Project management
├── tasks/          # Task management
├── users/          # User management
└── shared/         # Shared utilities and types
```

## Module Structure

Each module should follow this structure:

```
module-name/
├── models/         # Domain models and types
├── services/       # Business logic and services
├── validators/     # Validation schemas
├── utils/          # Module-specific utilities
└── index.ts        # Public API exports
```

## Best Practices

1. Each module should have clear boundaries and responsibilities
2. Modules should communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. Keep cross-module dependencies to a minimum
4. Use the shared module for common utilities and types
5. Follow consistent naming conventions across modules
